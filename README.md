# osu-calc-length-bonus

There are two directories in this project: "map-calc", which calculates a specific map, and "profile-calc", which calculates play for a whole profile.

You should run "gui.py" for map calculation and "profile_gui.py" for profile calculation.

If you are calculating a profile, you will need your API key. You can get an API key at this website: https://osu.ppy.sh/p/api

Precompiled binaries can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/MBmasher/osu-calc-length-bonus/releases)
